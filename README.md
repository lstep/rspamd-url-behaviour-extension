# URL Behaviour extension for RSPAMd

Goal of this project is to implement an extension for RSPAMd that is capable of examining all the urls in an email with the following features:

- [ ] Check for redirections, and if too many (> 2 for example), will trigger 
- [ ] send url to a snadbox and examine its content (AI, visual check)
